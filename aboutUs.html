    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        The idea behind Pretty & Protected was inspired by Women's History Month. Inspired to bring about awareness on women's safety, as well as the growing diversity initiatives in STEM, we decided to combine both of these ideas into our app. Feeling safe and secure
        on the go was the reason we decided to go with an Apple Watch application. However, we would love to see this take the form of a mobile app that is available to android users and ios users. This is our team's first ever hackathon, and we are super proud
        of this idea and prototype. What other features would you like to see added?
    </p>
