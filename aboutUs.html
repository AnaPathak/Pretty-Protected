    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
     The idea behind Pretty&Protected was inspired by Women's History Month. Inspired 
     to bring about awareness on women's safety as well as the growing diveristy initiatives
     in STEM we decided to combine both these ideas in our app. 
     Feeling safe and secure on the go was the reason we decided to go with an apple watch app.
     However, we would love to see this take the form of a mobile app that is avaible to android
     users and ios users. 
     This is our Team's first ever hackathon and we are super proud of this app idea and protoype.
     What features would you like to see added?
